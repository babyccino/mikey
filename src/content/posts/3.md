The command line tool [Yo Code extension generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-code) will create all the files you need to build your theme.

1. Open up your terminal window and navigate to your main GitHub folder.
2. Then run on the terminal:

```
npm install -g yo generator-code
```

After the it finishes installing run:

```bash
yo code
```

The following files are generated by Yo Code

## Building your theme

Go to "your-theme.json" file in the themes folder

## Publish your theme

To publish your theme we will need to do some boring work but is less cumbersome to be able to share your theme.

  **Inside the marketplace**

  There should be a "Create publisher" page.

## Going back to our package.json

The package.json files is not completed when yo code generates it for you, the marketplace requires other scopes like, icons, keywords, publish id and so on.
Feel free to use this template that I made, is basic, but that's all you need.
{% gist https://gist.github.com/michael-andreuzza/d5d535a521a120467fd4d5dfd5523e83 %}
If you are going to make dark and light version you will have to link both of json files here.
as you can see there's a difference for the light themes:

```json
"uiTheme": "vs-dark",
"uiTheme": "vs",
```

Formatted the contributes like this, stack the theme's like this.

```json
 "contributes": {
    "themes": [
      {
        "label": "Your dark theme name",
        "uiTheme": "vs-dark",
        "path": "./themes/your-dark-theme-name.json"
      },
      {
        "label": "Your light theme name",
        "uiTheme": "vs",
        "path": "./themes/your-light-theme-name.json"
      }
    ]
  }
```

The first theme is the one that is going to be debugged as default, if you want to debugged the light, in this case you will have to put it on the top, so the debugger can identify which theme you want to debug.

## LEt's install VSCE so we can push our theme to the marketplace.

Write this command on your terminal
`npm install -g vsce`
After is installed you will have to log in:
`vsce login your-publish-id`
it will for the login code, now is when you need to paste the token that we generated before.
To package your theme run
`vsce package`
it will create a vsix file.

> Note: This file you also use to publish on openVSX
> Publish your theme by running:
> `vsce publish`
> if all goes as it should, you will get a terminal msg and/or an email that your theme has been published.
> Go to your publisher page and you should see your theme deployed, it will say verifying, just be patience, it takes some minutes.
> Look for your live extension on the marketplace by clicking the menu on this ones.
> ![Image grsduvtr](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cjz6cc0d6ul4zt9oyqzl.png)
> If you want to update your theme and publish again, all you instead of running:
> `vsce publish`
> you can run:
> `vsce publish minor`
> just make sure you are logged in every time you do so.
